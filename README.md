### Challenge Assignment #2: Professional Portfolio

This webpage was built by Delaney Charney for Challenge Assignment No.2 of the UCF Coding Bootcamp. The requirements for the assignment are detailed below.

---

## User Story

    AS AN employer
        I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
        SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

---

## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
        WHEN I load their portfolio
            THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
        WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
            THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
        WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
            THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
        WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
            THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
        WHEN I click on the images of the applications
            THEN I am taken to that deployed application
        WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
            THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
